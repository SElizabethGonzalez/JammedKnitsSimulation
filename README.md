# JammedKnitsSimulation
Simulation for "Pulling apart the mechanisms that lead to jammed knitted fabrics."

Simulation results and experimental data will be hosted in a separate repository due to size constraints, DOI incoming.

The other README in this folder is for the simulation itself.

Code in the other folders (contactforce or contactvolumecode) processes existing simulation results to extract either the contact forces or volumes, respectively.
